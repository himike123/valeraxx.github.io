            <h3>Music</h3>

            <h4>The Play Command</h4>
            <p>The play command will play any song on youtube (provided you give it the right arguments), lets say you wanted to play Juice WRLD you will type "(guild Prefix)play screw juice juice wrld" the bot will show you a list of 10 songs to choose from select the number and the bot will join and play the song of your choice.</p>
            <h4>The Skip Command</h4>
            <p>This command is basic it just (guild prefix)skip and it will skip the song thats playing.</p>
            <h4>the Stop Command</h4>
            <p>This command will Stop and clear the queue of what ever song is playing, the bot will then leave the voice channel</p>
            <h4>the Queue Command</h4>
            <p>The command will Allow you to view song waiting to be played.</p>
            <h4>the Now Playing command (np)</h4>

            <h3>The Commands listed above are part of the Music Module of the bot</h3>
            <h1>Moderation</h1>
            <p>Everything in moderation is quite simple, here is what the commands should look like:</p>
            <p>Kick ^User^ ^Reason^</p>
            <p>Ban ^User^ ^Reason^</p>

            <p>lock: Lock locksdown the entire server execpt those with permissions, the lock command uses roles instead of user ID, so you can remove people from the lock role and allow them to speak in the server.</p>
